# Notes to consider

## Initialization
* Maximize use of 30 secs initialization time
    * Determine rich area
    * Determine best dock placement
    * Determine most efficient approach to rich areas (tunneling?)
        * Need to consider going back home (shipyard/dock)

## Movements
* Types of movements:
    * Harvesting
    * Inspired Harvesting
    * Returning
    * Docking (set to build a dock)
    * Attacking (get enemy with high halite)
* Prevent collisions

## Machine Learning
* Training
* Predicting

## End game
* All ships must return to docks to maximize halite
